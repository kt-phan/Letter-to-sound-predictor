## üß† Project Overview
Our project aims to build a **grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) converter**, which predicts how a written word should be pronounced.  
The system takes a **word as input** and outputs a **sequence of phonemes** by classifying each letter based on its surrounding context.  
For this milestone, we implement a **Decision Tree classifier** trained on aligned letter‚Äìphoneme pairs extracted from the **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup
## 1. Create the Environment

In your project folder, run the following to create the virtual environment (only needs to happen once on set-up):
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
To activate the virtual environment on subsequent logins you must run the below commands:

Windows:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Mac/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Finall, to install any necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To close the virtual environment, run:
```bash
deactivate
```
