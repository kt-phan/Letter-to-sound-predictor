## üß† Project Overview
Our project aims to build a **grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) converter**, which predicts how a written word should be pronounced.  
The system takes a **word as input** and outputs a **sequence of phonemes** by classifying each letter based on its surrounding context.  
For this milestone, we implement a **Decision Tree classifier** trained on aligned letter‚Äìphoneme pairs extracted from the **CMU Pronouncing Dictionary**.
